    "1. An initializer for the struct was automatically created with signature `init(board: [[Int]])`\n",
    "1. A class is a reference type, whereas a struct is a value type. This means that, for example, when you pass classes around in Swift or Python code, you're passing a reference to a class. When you pass a struct around, you're passing around copies of that struct.\n",

    "print(a)\n",
    "print(moveUp(location: a))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, a structure is a value type - therefore, Swift must pass a copy to the function for it to modify, right? Wrong! Swift is actually passing to the function a reference to the structure. However, if the function attempts to modify that reference, only then will Swift create a copy of the struct. It's very intelligent behaviour.\n",
