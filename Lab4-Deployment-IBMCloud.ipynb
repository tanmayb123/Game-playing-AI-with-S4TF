    "Now that you've worked on the main logic behind the 2048-playing AI, it's time to expose it to the web! To do so, you'll be using a slightly modified version of Gabriele Cirulli's original 2048 game from Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the architecture of the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You'll define the Monte Carlo Tree Search function as in Lab 4.\n",
    "1. You'll use Kitura to expose a REST API which takes a 2048 game state, and returns the best move to take.\n",
    "1. You'll use a pre-modified version of the 2048 game which works the same, except that it listens for a keypress on \"t\". When you click the \"t\" key, it'll start autoplaying the game by using the REST API you create.\n",
    "1. Kitura will host the 2048 game itself, enabling you to interact with it on IBM Cloud."

So, in order to reduce the amount of code you need to write, I've included the majority of it in a Github repo for you already. Let's clone that here:"

    "    1. Builds to an executable.\n",
    "    1. Requires version 2.6 of `Kitura`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then, the `Procfile` makes sure that IBM Cloud knows how to build and run your application. This is the content:\n",

    "`web: swift run -Xswiftc -O -Xcxx -Ofast -Xcxx -funroll-loops -Xcc -ffast-math -Xcc -Ofast`\n",

    "1. Compile Swift with full speed optimizations.\n",
    "1. Tell the C & C++ compilers to use full speed optimizations.\n",
    "1. Tell the C++ compiler to unroll loops (this is an optimization that makes compile time slower, but run time faster).\n",
    "\n",
    "And, finally, the cherry on top, `main.swift`! This is what the file contains:\n",

    "```\n",
    "import Foundation\n",
    "import Kitura\n",
    "\n",
    "let router = Router()\n",

    "router.get(\"/analyze\") { request, response, next in\n",

    "Kitura.addHTTPServer(onPort: 8080, with: router)\n",
    "Kitura.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm nearly sure you should be able to understand this code by now. Let me take you through it step by step:\n",
    "1. You start by importing Foundation and Kitura.\n",
    "1. You tell Kitura that you need a `StaticFileServer` on endpoint `/`. This means that whenever someone goes to the root of this website, they'll see the contents from the `public` folder. So, for example, if your app name is `tb2048`, when someone heads over to `tb2048.mybluemix.net/`, they'll be greeted with the `index.html` page from the `public` folder you created. This is possible thanks to the `StaticFileServer`.\n",
    "1. You tell Kitura to take any GET requests sent to the `/analyze` endpoint, and call a function to figure out what to do next. This function that we've defined will take the board state that was passed through the REST API, and create a convenient internal representation out of it (you built this in lab 3). Then, it'll use Monte Carlo Tree Search to find the best move and return it as a response.\n",
    "1. You finally tell Kitura to start this HTTP server on port 8080, which is the port that IBM Cloud expects you to run on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's _that_ easy to use Kitura! Now, let's go ahead and push this to IBM Cloud. To do so, you'll need to log in first. In the cell below, insert the following in sequence:\n",
