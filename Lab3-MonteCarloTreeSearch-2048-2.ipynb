    "# Time-bounded Monte Carlo Tree Search for 2048\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we will create a time-bounded Monte Carlo Tree Search-powered player for the game of 2048. This is an incredibly challenging & stochastic game that scales in difficulty exponentially as the game continues. Because of this, neural networks aren't particularly great at playing 2048. This is why other algorithms, like Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax, and Monte Carlo Tree Search are used instead."

    "Anyway, now that we've got that out of the way, we can focus on what you're here to learn: how do you play this thing automatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of this method, it's quite simple: but results in a very efficient player! In order to play random moves in a time-bounded environment in parallel, let's create a function `monteCarloSearch(state: Game2048) -> Game2048.Direction`. Essentially, this function will take a game state, and will return a direction in which to move - the direction that MCTS believes is currently optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of this function, there's a nested helper function - `performRollout(state: Game2048, direction: Game2048.Direction) -> Double`. This function will take a game state and a direction to score, and will perform random moves after the initial one. Once it finishes the game (either loses or wins), it'll return the score of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the meat of the algorithm: you start by noting down the valid directions (which moves are currently legal). If there's only one legal move, then it's the only move that you can take regardless of future score - so return it. If not, then continue with the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you define the maximum time that the algorithm is allowed to take to make a decision. In this case, I've set it to 0.015 seconds. If you have slower performing hardware, you can set it to a higher number to get a better player. Remember, the more time you allocate to MCTS, the better! At this time, you'll also initialize the scores for all 4 possible directions - initially, these are zero. At least one move must be legal at this point, and therefore, at least one move will have a score higher than zero when the algorithm is done executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to actually score the moves! If the machine you're running on has more than 1 core, it'll distribute this process on as many as possible, up until a maximum of 4 cores (as in, one direction being scored per core). In order to make this easy, Apple's cross-platform & Swift-compatible `Dispatch` library has a static function `concurrentPerform`, which enables you to perform many iterations of a task concurrently. In this case, the number of iterations is equal to the number of possible directions to move in. `concurrentPerform` is fed with an anonymous function (also called a [closure](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html)). This closure takes the current iteration number, and does some processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the \"processing\" refers to the scoring of a direction. This is how the scoring is done:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an array of Double values called `scores`, to store the scores that are calculated.\n",
    "1. Create a new integer variable `rollouts`, initialized to zero, to keep track of the number of rollouts that are run.\n",
    "1. Define a constant that contains the maximum time until which the rollouts are allowed to be calculated.\n",
    "1. Create a repeat-while loop, running the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Increment `rollouts`.\n",
    "    1. Perform a rollout and store the score.\n",
    "    1. Append the score to `scores`.\n",
    "    1. Repeat if the current time is less than or equal to the maximum time alloted\n",
    "1. Determine the average score by dividing the sum of `scores` by `rollouts`.\n",
    "1. Set the respective direction's score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, put the directions & their scores into a dictionary, and return the direction with the highest average score."
